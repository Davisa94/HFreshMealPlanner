Goal:
Phase 1: Take the paper recipe cards sent with hello fresh meals and scan them into a system that will allow them to be digitized via OCR and then added to a recipe database, phase 1.

Phase 2: Create a system with Natural Language processing that can read the recipe database and help with meal plans and finding a recipe to suit given ingredients. For example you have a list of ingredients from you fridge and pantry and then the system will search the recipes that closest fit the given recipes and listing the missing ingredients for each.

Phase 3: improvments such as tracking bought ingredients via scanned recipts or manual entry; perhaps support expiration dates to make meal planning more effecient and decrease the possibility of wasting ingredients.


Phase 4: Improve Phase 2's Command line interface with a Web UI; Include images of recipes with modern UI components
